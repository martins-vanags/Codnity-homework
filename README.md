Laravel 8 / Vue.js task

1) Create a scraper that reads data from
   https://news.ycombinator.com/ (title, link, points, date created)
   1.2) Store data to a local database (Postgres or MySQL)
   1.3) Scraper also must update points for each article
   1.4) It must be run from the console

2) Create frontend part:
   2.1) Accessible only by username/password (user data must be in DB)
   2.2) Display all scraped information using DataTables, 10 entries per package
   2.3) Add the possibility to delete an item - if itâ€™s deleted, then do not update it from Hacker News.

Create a readme file on how to set up the site
Put all code in github/gitlab repository.

Bonus points: Docker usage, Unit tests.

installation:
composer install
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
add database credentials
create database with name testing for phpunit tests // config in .xml
php artisan scrape:hacker-news // to run the command
php artisan test // for the tests
// created no FE but added routes to imitate it
// not sure if auth works as expected because no views are in resources/views/..
// hopefully the tests don't fail, didn't have the time to test.
